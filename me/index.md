I'm a 15 year old game developer/programmer/3d modeler/pixel artist/content creator and beyond. Since the very month of November 2017, I started tinkering around with Python (which I nowadays dislike, cause i do) then went to Java, then C++! Since then, I've also gotten some skills on Lua, and someday may combine the use of the two to become the Lord of Programming!<sub>citation needed</sub>
