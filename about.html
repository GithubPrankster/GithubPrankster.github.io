                <h2>Behold now, infomation about me!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a solo indie gamedev most known for making very weird and cool games, and also programming with C, Lua and Assembly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At only 16 years old, I have created many games you can find on itch.io (link above!), usually unfinished, but sometimes or
                    other I come up with many interesting things. Go to my Discord or Twitter to find out the daily life of a dude who keeps on
                    making these things, and also eats chocolate bars in less than a hour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I make my games with <i>Aseprite, Blender, VS Code, Audacity, OBS, Inkscape</i>! It's Free and Open Source software in this house.
                    Also, I have an interest for music (16bit 44,1kHz ftw) and have always loved game soundtracks due to that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also do commissions on Ko-Fi! Be it pixel-art, 3d renders, or even logos, you can count on me <b>delivering as soon as I can!</b>

                </p>

                <p> 
                    Heard all that? Great, why don't you see too my stuff on Youtube? (link also above!) I make videos from time to time. 
                    (as of 01/12/2019, has not entirely completed a playthrough of Deltarune on camera, somehow.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are free to chat with me, as long as you are a nice person. Meanies suck. Don't be them. (Please also have actually 
                    something to say...)
