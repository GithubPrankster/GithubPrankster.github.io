            <h1>/*/*/ The Future is Raytraced</h1>

	        <section>
                <h2>What is a "raytracing", dear lad?</h2>
                <p>
                    Raytracing is a technique commonly used for graphics processing in
                    which tens of thousands of "rays", commonly an extension of vectors,
                    are thrown about in a scene, capturing data from hit geometry or reporting the lack
                    there of. This is then used to construct a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish they explained it more like this. This is anyways a pretty light
                    interpretation of the algorithm but you get the point. This process is
                    focused on being accurate and capable of being highly parallelized
                    (that is, run by the multiple cores of the processing units of your
                    machine pretty well),
                    and also capable of producing very photo-realistic imagery.
                </p>
                <h2>So what's the deal now?</h2>
                <p>
                    Until recent years, while this was known to be the case, we used the
                    Rasterization algorithm instead, which is able to be extremely more quick
                    but requiring lots of tricks to make it look very good. However,
                    graphics processing units are starting to implement cores and algorithms
                    that can process Raytracing fast enough that we can now do some of it in
                    Real-Time. Yes, that's the RTX that nvidia loves to talk about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are still pretty expensive, and not many games use it, and neither is
                    the usage pretty crazy. Mostly it is used for reflections, an often tricky
                    thing to do in Rasterization which can either take too long or look odd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, 3D rendering in gaming started too as a gimmick people said it would never catch on,
                    and now all the big games use it. Raytracing is no different. It'll bring
                    accurate rendering and ease in construction of effects and ideas like
                    never seen before. Imagine the mirror actually correctly reacting to
                    you throwing a cube at it. Or lightning being highly dynamic and
                    correct as far as our understanding of physics goes. We could already
                    do it in Rasterization, but always odd. And now we're even! (not me tho)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the Vulkan API has recently introduced an extension to bring a common
                    Raytracing platform for both nvidia and amd. This will hopefully make it easier
                    for developers to have Raytracing for games that can work on both graphics cards
                    and so on. Still pretty early to say but that's what I hope! We all can have
                    little a Raytracing.

                <h2>Where do I look for more info?</h2>
                <p>
                    Fear not! I keep tabs on game dev discords, channels, discord channels and 
                    twitter. I have a few things in mind you could take a look at to get better
                    informed. Be aware you may need some programming language knowledge,
                    (preferably C, C++, etc. but weblangs and others are ok!)
                    but you can try learning some in your own pace.
