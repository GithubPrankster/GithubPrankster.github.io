                <p>
                    It has been some days ever since I have stepped into the new decade. Currently working on Bravelight, which you can find development on more in my
                    Discord Server, link above. I am using C++ for this since it is more compatible and possibly faster. It has been fun to comeback to OpenGL with more
                    smarts! Soon i'll also add Lua to make things load without needing to "make" everytime.

                    This is the first update post of the brand new Uneven Prankster website. It's a pleasure to see a more simple look into the website, and I certainly hope
                    you'll love it. This format will let me have more control over every post, blog, and even a page for games and their development! I hope you have a very
                    nice start of December! :D
