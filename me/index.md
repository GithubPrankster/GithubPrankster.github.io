I'm a 16 year old game developer/programmer/3d modeler/pixel artist/content creator and beyond. Since the very month of November 2017, I started tinkering around with Python (which I nowadays dislike, cause i do) then went to Java, then C++, and now C. Since then, I've also gotten some skills on Lua and even Assembly, and someday may combine the use of them all to become the Lord of Programming!(citation needed)

You can find me on a lot of places on the tabs above. Click 'em! See 'em! Tell me your thoughts on places like Twitter and Discord. I respond very quickly. (Seriously.)
