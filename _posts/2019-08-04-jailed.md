# A post about making a less popular sort of game

![Ur jailed!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429387300535926784/633746677890809885/inkscape_2019-10-14_21-06-05.png)

*jailed.* is my first ever game done using C/Lua in conjunction. It's also my first ever text game, and game with more than 1k lines of dialogue and beyond. It not only is a breakthrough for me technologically, but also a special point in my journey in game making, and also lying beneath the text, my opinion overall of gaming post-undertale.

How many text games are made today, compared to all those graphical, charming, pixel art deep story crazy writting trips you see all the time?

*What what do you mean they don't do console based games much anymore?*

Lets get this out of the way first. Most visual novels are considered text games. But they have icky *graphics*. And that is most enough for me to consider them **not**-text games. They are **somewhat**-text games. The problem is they're not *100%* text. And you know me, we gotta go for the top.

Even searching *terminal* type games on ***itch.io*** does not yield much. It's all filled with the graphics. They take the aesthetic of terminal based, sure, but I barely find much.

So, I decided to change that. And I learned some good and bad things about the console prompt too.

***First: Lua is incredible for text!!!***

*Not kidding.* It has some awesome features for searching keywords, string length, putting strings together, all sorts of wonderful stuff. You may as well just use it. C cannot even compare.

***Second: Microsoft hates you.***

Why did it take ***40*** years for Microsoft to consider ANSI escape code support? *WHY DOES IT NOT WORK ON THE COMMAND PROMPT?!* I do not know, and it's best we not linger on this much unless we start to go insane.

***Third: Colors make the text happy and fun.***

Sprinkle color and watch the boring color of text become more interesting. In such a limited medium, all the cool features *can* and *should* be used. Even making the player name red already conveys some importance to it. From a book to a screen, we were bound to make things more interesting.

***Fourth, and less sensical: Writing it weird.***

**WARNING: SPOILERS FOR jailed. AHEAD**

The game follows the "player" attempting to get out of jail. This story has been done hundreds of times already. How do you make it interesting? *Writing it weird*. I love the meta, and you can see it right in the slogan of the game. *A metatextual adventure*. There are constant exploits of how commands and dialogue are written. Example, even with the first 3 prompts, the one to call for help does not specify *the way you call for help*. Therefore, the dialogue makes the reader quickly realize they had been using a telephone to do such deed. We therefore, make what would be a throwaway option to further poke the player into the right path into one of many jokes that prepares the player for the ever increasing unstableness of the game's structure.

This goes further where after 3 prompts, you officially can branch, where after being exposed to more strange situations, you go into what I call the "Narrative Rabbit Hole", where you go further and further into the nonsense, exposing to the player how the game is not acting normal, but at the same time shows whatever is going on behind the scene *intentionally wants you thinking that way*. We also start dealing with the game!Author and an exploration of the meta in gaming. All that from a dumb jail plot. Gettin' weird with it is cool.

**WARNING: NO SPOILERS FOR jailed. AHEAD, YOU ARE SAFE NOW**

The game will be released *friday*, and will be a new game in some time now. I hope you'll love it. I have long been itching to write dialogue in games, and now here it is.
