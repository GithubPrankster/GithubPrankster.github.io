                <h2>It's-The-Infomation!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a indiedev most known for making very weird and cool games, and also programming them almost solely using
                    C and Lua + the many formats I experiment with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At only 17 years old, I have created many games you can find on itch.io (link above!), mostly unfinished, but sometimes or
                    other I come up with few finished works. Go to my Discord or Twitter to find out the daily life of a dude who keeps on
                    making these things, and also eats chocolate bars in less than a hour. (or half of one)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I make my games with <i>Aseprite, Blender, Audacity, OBS, Inkscape</i>! It's Free and Open Source software in this house.
                    Also, I have some interest for music (16bit 44,1kHz ftw) and have always loved game soundtracks due to that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also do commissions on Ko-Fi! Be it pixel-art, 3d renders, or even logos, you can count on me <b>delivering as soon as I can!</b>

                </p>

                <p> 
                    Heard all that? Great, why don't you see too my stuff on Youtube? (link also above!) I make videos from time to time. 
                    (as of 04/27/2020, has <i>truly</i> entirely completed a playthrough of Deltarune on camera.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are free to chat with me, as long as you're cool. Meanies suck. Don't be them. (Please also have actually 
                    something to say...)
