Hello, I'm Uneven Prankster, the master of pure nonsense and games. Since I was 13, from November 2017 to onwards, I started trying to program things, because I always wanted to make a game. Since then, I made [some](https://unevenprankster.itch.io) and also many programs on my github, which you can find below in that lil' icon. Check my twitter and youtube too! I post lots of stuff.
